## BITCOIN STOCK-TO-FLOW (STF) MODEL
STF model is a model that describes how much supply enters into a market in a particular period, usually yearly, for a given resource relative to its total supply. This means that the higher the STF ratio, the less new supply to the market relative to the total supply. The STF model is a way of measuring the abundance of a particular resource.
Hence, Bitcoin STF model measures the issuance of new Bitcoins each block against existing supply.
